Assets are the static resources that your game loads to run. These can be:

- Images
- JSON files
- Audio files
- Fonts
- Spritesheets
- [Spine animations](/guides/spine)

## Loading Assets

Setting up your build tools per our [project setup](/guides/project-setup#build-tools) guide will
automatically copy your assets to the correct location whether you're developing locally or building for production.

### From the Application

You can load assets that are available globally to the entire application by defining them in
the `requiredAssets()` getter in the `Application.ts` file or where your application is defined.

```js
// Application.ts
import { 
  AssetMapData, 
  TextureAsset, 
  AssetType, 
  JsonAsset,
  AudioAsset,
  FontAsset,
} from 'dill-pixel';

...

public get requiredAssets(): AssetMapData[] {
  return [
    new TextureAsset('foo', AssetType.PNG),
    new TextureAsset('bar', AssetType.JPG),
    new JsonAsset('config'),
    new AudioAsset('bang', 'sfx'),
    new FontAsset('myFont'),
  ];
}

```

<Aside type="tip">
  When preloading audio files you have to specify [their category](/guides/audio#categories).
</Aside>

### From a Game State

For assets that are only needed in a single [game state](/fundamentals/state),
you can define which assets you want to load in the `Assets()` getter of the game state:

```js
// MyGameState.ts
import {
  AssetMapData,
  TextureAtlasAsset, 
  JsonAsset, 
  TextureAsset, 
  AudioAsset, 
  AssetType 
} from 'dill-pixel';

...

public static get Assets(): AssetMapData[] {
  return [
    new TextureAtlasAsset('myspritesheet'),
    new JsonAsset('settings'),
    new TextureAsset('someImage', AssetType.JPG),
    new AudioAsset('killerSong', 'music'),
    new AudioAsset('splat', 'sfx'),
  ];
}

```

## Accessing Assets

Once your assets are loaded, you can access them in your game. The way you access them depends on the type of asset.

### Images

Images are loaded as `Texture` objects. You can access them by their key:

```js
// A single image

const myImage = this.add.sprite({ asset: 'foo', position: [-150, 50] });

// A sprite from a spritesheet

const mySprite = this.add.sprite({ asset: 'bar', sheet: 'myspritesheet', position: [150, 50] });
```

### JSON Files

JSON files are accessed using Pixi's `Cache` class. For example, if you have the following file:

```json
// config.json
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "baz": 42,
  "qux": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

You can access it in your game like this:

```js
import { Cache } from 'pixi.js';

const config = Cache.get('config');
console.log(config.foo); // Outputs "bar"
```

### Audio Files

Once audio files have been loaded, you can [play them](/guides/audio#playing-audio) using the `playAudioTrack` function:

```js

// Play a sound once

playAudioTrack('sound');

```

<Aside type="tip">
  Audio files don't actually have to be loaded in advance. Because they're streamed, you can
  play them on demand by just calling `playAudioTrack('sound');` and the file will be loaded and played.
</Aside>

### Fonts

The only font format that can be loaded using the asset manager is an `.fnt` file, which is a bitmap font.
Once a font has been loaded, you can use it in your game like this:

```js

const myBitmapText = this.add.bitmapText('Hello World!', { 
  fontName: 'myFont', 
  fontSize: 64,
  letterSpacing: -2, 
});

```
