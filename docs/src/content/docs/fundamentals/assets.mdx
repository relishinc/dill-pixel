Assets are the static resources that your game loads to run. These can be:

- Images
- Fonts
- JSON files
- [Spine animations](/guides/spine)
- Audio files
- Spritesheets

## Loading Assets

Setting up your build tools per our [project setup](/guides/project-setup#build-tools) guide will
automatically copy your assets to the correct location whether you're developing locally or building for production.

### From the Application

You can load assets that are available globally to the entire application by defining them in 
the `requiredAssets()` getter in the `Application.ts` file or where your application is defined.

```js
// Application.ts
import { AssetMapData, TextureAsset, AssetType, JsonAsset } from 'dill-pixel';

...

public get requiredAssets(): AssetMapData[] {
  return [
    new TextureAsset('foo', AssetType.PNG),
    new TextureAsset('bar', AssetType.JPG),
    new JsonAsset('config'),
  ];
}

```

### From a Game State

For assets that are only needed in a single [game state](/fundamentals/state),
you can define which assets you want to load in the `Assets()` getter of the game state:

```js
// MyGameState.ts
import { AssetMapData, TextureAtlasAsset, JsonAsset, TextureAsset, AssetType } from 'dill-pixel';

...

public static get Assets(): AssetMapData[] {
  return [
    new TextureAtlasAsset('myspritesheet'),
    new JsonAsset('settings'),
    new TextureAsset('someImage', AssetType.JPG),
  ];
}

```

## Accessing Assets

Once your assets are loaded, you can access them in your game. The way you access them depends on the type of asset.

### Images

Images are loaded as `Texture` objects. You can access them by their key:

```js

// A single image

this.add.sprite({ asset: 'foo', position: [-150, 50] });

// A sprite from a spritesheet

this.add.sprite({ asset: 'bar', sheet: 'myspritesheet', position: [150, 50] });

```

### JSON Files

JSON files are accessed using Pixi's `Cache` class. For example, if you have the following file:

```json
// config.json
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "baz": 42,
  "qux": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

You can access it in your game like this:

```js
import { Cache } from 'pixi.js';

const config = Cache.get('config')
console.log(config.foo); // Outputs "bar"

```
