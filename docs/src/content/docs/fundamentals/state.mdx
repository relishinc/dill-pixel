dill pixel uses a simple state management system to manage the different states (or screens)
in your game. For example, a simple game might have a `TitleScreen`, `GameScreen`, and `GameOverScreen`.
Let's see how we would include those in our game and switch between them.

## Creating a Base State

To create a new state, create a new file in the `src/states` directory. For example, let's create a `BaseState`
that all of our other game states will extend. This first state should extend dill pixel's [`State`](/api/classes/state) class
and for now we'll just add custom `animateIn` and `animateOut` methods that will fade all of our states in and out:

<Code code={baseStateTs} lang="ts" title="src/states/BaseState.ts" />

## Creating a Screen

Next, let's create a `TitleScreen` that extends our `BaseState`:

<Code code={titleScreenTs} lang="ts" title="src/states/TitleScreen.ts" />

## Registering States

Once all of the states have been created, they need to be registered with the game. This is done in the 
`src/Application.ts` file:

<Code code={applicationTs} lang="ts" title="src/Application.ts" />

## Switching Between States

To switch between states, use the `transitionTo` method on the game instance:

```ts

// From within the Application.ts file

this.state.transitionTo(TitleScreen.NAME) // reference by the class' NAME attribute
this.state.transitionTo('TitleScreen') // reference by the NAME attribute as a string

// From within a game state (e.g. TitleScreen.ts)

this.app.state.transitionTo(GameScreen.NAME)

```
