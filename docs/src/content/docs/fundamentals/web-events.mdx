The [WebEventsManager](/api/classes/webeventsmanager) class is responsible for capturing events 
that are triggered by the browser and notifying the game.

There are two types of events that are handled:

- [`visibilitychange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/visibilitychange_event) - triggered when the browser tab displaying the game is hidden or shown
- [`resize`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event) - triggered when the browser window is resized

## Adding an Event Listener

To add an event listener, you must first create a callback function that will be called when the event is triggered. 
Then, you can register the callback function with the `WebEventsManager` instance.

```js

// Create a visibility changed callback function

const visibilityChangedCallback = (isVisible: boolean): void => {
  if (isVisible) {
    console.log('The game is visible');
    // Re-enable animations, sounds, etc.
  } else {
    console.log('The game is hidden');
    // Disable animations, sounds, etc.
  }
}

// Add an event listener within a game state

this.app.webEvents.registerVisibilityChangedCallback(visibilityChangedCallback);

// To register a resize event listener

this.app.webEvents.registerResizeCallback(resizeCallback);

```

## Removing an Event Listener

To remove an event listener, pass a reference to your callback function:

```js

// Remove the event listener within a game state

this.app.webEvents.unregisterVisibilityChangedCallback(visibilityChangedCallback);

// To remove a resize event listener

this.app.webEvents.unregisterResizeCallback(resizeCallback);

```
