dill pixel uses the [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) audio library for playing sounds and music in your game.

## Playing Audio

If you have two audio files – `sound.mp3` and `sound.webm` – in your `src/assets/audio/output` folder and
you've [configured Vite to serve the assets](/guides/project-setup#build-tools), you can load
them into your game like this:

```js
import { playAudioTrack, pauseAudioTrack } from 'dill-pixel';

...

// Play an audio track

playAudioTrack('sound');

// Play an audio track at 50% volume

playAudioTrack('sound', 0.5);

// Play an audio track on a loop

playAudioTrack('sound', 1, true);

// Pause an audio track

pauseAudioTrack('sound');

```

## Categories

Audio tracks can be categorized, which allows similar types of sounds 
to be grouped together. This can be useful for controlling the volume of a group of sounds (e.g. sound effects, background music, voiceovers)

```js

import { setAudioCategoryVolume, playAudioTrack } from 'dill-pixel';

...

// Play an audio track in the 'sfx' category

playAudioTrack('foo', 1, false, 'sfx');

// Play an audio track in the 'music' category

playAudioTrack('bar', 1, true, 'music');

// Set the volume of all 'sfx' sounds to 50% of their original volume

setAudioCategoryVolume('sfx', 0.5);

```
