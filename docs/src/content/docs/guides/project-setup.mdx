## Organizing Files and Directories

We recommend setting up your project directory as follows:

<FileTree>
- package.json
- README.md
- vite.config.js
- tsconfig.json
- index.html
- **src**
		- index.css	  
	- index.ts
	- Application.ts
	- assets static assets like fonts, images, and audio
		- …		
	- states where your game states are stored
      - SplashScreen.ts
      - IntroScreen.ts
      - GameScreen.ts
      - HighScoresScreen.ts
	- …		
</FileTree>

## Build Tools

To develop your game locally and build it for production, you'll need to configure a 
build process. We recommend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), a blazing fast build tool 
that supports modern JavaScript features.
