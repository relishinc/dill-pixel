Framework for HTML game development, made by Relish Studios [https://reli.sh].

## Introduction

### Why make this game framework?

PIXI.js is a great rendering engine, but it is not a game engine. It is not opinionated about project structure and does not provide any common game development tools. This framework is designed to fill that gap. It is Relish's opinionated approach to game development using PIXI.js.

### Core Features

<!-- TODO: Add the core features from the site once they are settled on -->

## Prerequisites

This framework is intended for HTML game developers. You should have a working knowledge of game development, PixiJS, and Typescript to get started.

## Installation

<!-- TODO: create some basic installation instructions -->

## Usage

<!-- TODO: provide a couple cool code samples -->


## Documentation

* Available here: [Docs](https://docs.dillpixel.io)
* Documentation is very much a work in progress and is incomplete. 

### Migrating from the old HLF framework

If you are a Relish developer you should know HLF is changing to Dill Pixel! View the [Migration Guide](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for more information. Looking for old info that was in the README? Look for the Legacy HLF Guide under references in the docs.

## Development 

### How to build ###

Note that for most users you don't need to build this project. If all you want is to use PixiJS, then
just download one of our [prebuilt releases](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases). 
The only time you should need to build PixiJS is if you are developing it.

If you don't already have Node.js and NPM, go install them. Then, in the folder where you have cloned
the repository, install the build dependencies using npm:

```sh
npm install
```

For development:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To build the source:

```sh
npm run build
```

### How to generate the documentation ###

The docs can be generated using npm:

```sh
npm run docs
```

The documentation uses [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) an Astro based framework for documentation.

### Testing

<!-- TODO: Describe how to run the test suite. -->
