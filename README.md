# Dill Pixel

Framework for HTML game development, made by Relish Studios [https://reli.sh].

### Introduction

#### Why make this game framework?

PIXI.js is a great rendering engine, but it is not a game engine. It is not opinionated about project structure and does not provide any common game development tools. This framework is designed to fill that gap. It is Relish's opinionated approach to game development using PIXI.js.

### Documentation

* Available here: [Docs](https://docs.dillpixel.io)
* Documentation is a work in progress and is incomplete. 

### Migrating from the old HLF framework

If you are a Relish developer you should know HLF is changing to Dill Pixel! View the [Migration Guide](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for more information. Looking for old info that was in the README? Look for the Legacy HLF Guide under references in the docs.
