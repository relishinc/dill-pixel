dill pixel supports the [Spine format](https://esotericsoftware.com/) for animations. 
Spine is a 2D skeletal animation tool that allows you to animate 2D characters and objects 
in a way that is similar to how 3D animations are done. This allows for more complex 
animations and more efficient use of resources.

## Getting Started

To work with Spine in dill pixel you'll need to include [pixi-spine](https://github.com/pixijs/spine)

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label={"npm"}>
		```bash
		npm i pixi-spine
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label={"yarn"}>
		```bash
		yarn add pixi-spine
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label={"pnpm"}>
		```bash
		pnpm install pixi-spine
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Loading a Spine Animation

If you have a Spine animation called `spineboy-pro` in your `src/assets/spine` folder and
you've [configured Vite to serve the assets](/guides/project-setup#build-tools), you can load it into your game like this:

```js

import { AssetMapData, SpineAsset } from 'dill-pixel';
import { Spine } from 'pixi-spine';

...

// Declare the variable to hold the spine animation

private _spine: Spine;

...

// Load the spine asset

public static get Assets(): AssetMapData[] {
  return [new SpineAsset('spineboy-pro')];
}

// Create the spine object

this._spine = this.add.spine({
  name: 'spineboy-pro',
  autoUpdate: true,
  scale: 0.5,
  position: [0, 100],
});

```

## Playing an Animation

To play an animation on the spine object, call `.state.setAnimation` with the track number, 
the animation name, and whether the animation should loop or not:

```js

// Play an animation

this._spine.state.setAnimation(0, 'walk', true);

```
