In the [Quick Start guide](./quick-start), we learned how to set up a very simple project using dill pixel.
Now let's go through the process of creating a basic game.

## Setup the Files

<Steps>

1. First, create a `package.json` in your project's root directory:

	<Code code={packageJson} lang="json" title="package.json" />

2. Create a `vite.config.js` file in the root directory to configure the build process. The default Vite configuration
is sufficient but for handling static assets we're using the [vite-plugin-static-copy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-static-copy) 
so that they can be loaded from within the game. You can configure the plugin
however you like based on how you've organized your assets.

	<Code code={viteConfigJs} lang="js" title="vite.config.js" />

3. Next, create an `index.html` file in the root directory. This file will be the entry point for your 
game and dill pixel will automatically create a `<div id="game-container" />` to contain the game canvas:

	<Code code={indexHtml} lang="html" title="index.html" />

4. Create an `index.css` file in the `src` directory that displays the game at full screen:

	<Code code={indexCss} lang="css" title="src/index.css" />

5. Create an `index.ts` file in the `src` directory that initializes the game:

	<Code code={indexTs} lang="ts" title="src/index.ts" />

</Steps>

## Create the Game States

### Loading Screen

Create a `state` folder in the `src` directory and create a `LoadScreen.ts` file in it. This will 
be displayed while the game is loading and also when transitioning between states.

To manage the transitions smoothly, we're using `gsap` to fade the loading screen in and out 
in the `animateIn()` and `animateOut()` methods:

<Code code={loadScreenTs} lang="ts" title="src/state/LoadScreen.ts" />

### Intro Screen

Create an `IntroScreen.ts` file in the `state` folder. This will be displayed when the game starts. 
Similar to the `LoadScreen`, there are `animateIn()` and `animateOut()` methods to control how the screen 
is revealed and hidden. For simplicity's sake we're just creating a green background and adding a title 
that can be clicked to take us to the next screen:

<Code code={introScreenTs} lang="ts" title="src/state/IntroScreen.ts" />

### Game Screen

Create a `GameScreen.ts` file in the `state` folder. This will be the main game screen with a few
elements: an image, a title, a message, and a button.

Clicking on the image will trigger a short animation and increment a counter. Clicking the 
button will take us back to the `IntroScreen`.

Note that in the `destroy()` method we're cleaning up the `gsap` animations.

<Code code={gameScreenTs} lang="ts" title="src/state/GameScreen.ts" />

## Create the Application

Create an `Application.ts` file in the `src` directory. This is the main application class that will
manage the game states and transitions between them:

<Code code={applicationTs} lang="ts" title="src/Application.ts" />

### Install the Dependencies

Once you have created the files, install the dependencies:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label={"npm"}>
		```bash
		npm install
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label={"yarn"}>
		```bash
		yarn install
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label={"pnpm"}>
		```bash
		pnpm install
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Run the Game

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label={"npm"}>
		```bash
		npm run dev
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label={"yarn"}>
		```bash
		yarn dev
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label={"pnpm"}>
		```bash
		pnpm run dev
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
