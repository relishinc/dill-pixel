## KeyboardManager
The `KeyboardManager` class is responsible for handling keyboard inputs in your game. It's part of
 a system that includes focus management and input handling.

It tracks the state of the keyboard and the application. The `_downKeys` set keeps track of which
keys are currently being pressed.

The `KeyboardManager` registers event listeners for various keyboard and mouse events. It also connects several methods
 to signals, which are emitted when certain events occur.

```ts
// KeyboardManager.ts
window.addEventListener(InputUtils.Events.KEY_DOWN, this.onKeyDown.bind(this), false);
window.addEventListener(InputUtils.Events.POINTER_DOWN, this.onMouseDown.bind(this), false);
window.addEventListener(InputUtils.Events.KEY_UP, this.onKeyUp.bind(this), false);
window.addEventListener(InputUtils.Events.FOCUS, this.onBrowserFocus.bind(this));
window.addEventListener(InputUtils.Events.BLUR, this.onBrowserBlur.bind(this));
```

The `onKeyDown` and `onKeyUp` methods handle the pressing and releasing of keys, respectively. They update the `_downKeys` set and perform actions based on the keys pressed.

The `addKeyBinding` method allows your game to specify what action should be taken when a certain key is pressed. It
takes a direction (which could be an actual direction like 'up' or 'down', or 'Enter' for the enter key), a key code, and optional modifiers (like whether the alt, shift, or ctrl keys should be held down).

```ts
public addKeyBinding(
  pDirection: Direction | 'Enter',
  pKeyCode: KeyCodes,
  pModifiers?: Partial<{
    altKey: boolean;
    shiftKey: boolean;
    ctrlKey: boolean;
  }>,
)
```

The `removeKeyBinding` and `removeAllKeyBindings` methods allow the application to remove these bindings.

The `isKeyDown` method checks if a certain key or set of keys is currently being pressed.

The `onDirectionPressed` method is called when a direction key is pressed. It steps through the current `KeyboardMap` in the given direction.

## KeyboardFocusManager
The `KeyboardFocusManager` class is responsible for displaying on-screen indicators for focused elements. It listens
for changes in focus and updates the display accordingly. It's initialized with a type for rendering the focus indicator.

By default, this is the `DefaultKeyboardFocusManagerSprite` class, which renders a simple rectangle around the focused element.

The `KeyboardFocusManager` pools instances of the focus indicator class to avoid creating and destroying them constantly.

```ts
const focusManager = new KeyboardFocusManager<DefaultKeyboardFocusManagerSprite>(DefaultKeyboardFocusManagerSprite);
```
You can create your own focus indicator class by extending the `KeyboardFocusManagerSprite` class and overriding the
`draw` method, or by implementing the `IKeyboardFocus` interface:

```ts
// IKeyboardFocus.ts
IKeyboardFocus extends DisplayObject {
	readonly target: IFocusable | undefined;
	show(pFocusable: IFocusable): void;
	hide(pOnComplete?: () => void, pInstantly?: boolean): void;
	redraw(): void;
}
```
You can also tweak the `DefaultKeyboardFocusManagerSprite` class by just changing it's static properties:

```ts
// DefaultKeyboardFocusManagerSprite.ts
public static COLOR: number = 0xff0000;
public static PADDING: number = 4;
public static LINE_WIDTH: number = 2;
```

Like so:

```ts
// MyApplication.ts
protected setup() {

  // Change the color of the focus indicator

  DefaultKeyboardFocusManagerSprite.COLOR = 0x00ff00;

  // Change the padding around the focused element

  DefaultKeyboardFocusManagerSprite.PADDING = 8;

  // Change the width of the focus indicator

  DefaultKeyboardFocusManagerSprite.LINE_WIDTH = 4;
  
}
```

## Focusable Elements
Think of `KeyboardMap` as a layer of focusable elements. Each element has a `focusable` property, which is a boolean
that determines whether the element can be focused on. Anything in your game can be a focusable element if it has a
`focusable` property -- but for more granular control, make a custom class that extends Container, and implement the
`IFocusable` interface.

```ts
// IFocusable.ts
interface IFocusable {
   onFocusBegin(): void;
   onFocusEnd(): void;
   onFocusActivated(): void;
   getFocusPosition(): Point;
   getFocusSize(): IPoint;
   isFocusable?(): boolean;
}
```

## KeyboardMap
`KeyboardMap`s are used to manage keyboard focus for interactive elements in your game. It has several properties to
track the state of the keyboard and the application, and holds a list of focusable elements and their neighbours. It
also serves double-duty as a __*focus trap*__, preventing the user from navigating outside of the focusable elements.

The `pushMapLayer` and `popMapLayer` methods are used to manage layers of `KeyboardMap` objects. When a new layer is pushed, it becomes the active layer and the previous layer is deactivated. When a layer is popped, it is removed and the next layer down becomes active.

<Aside>
  You can also use the global `addKeyboardLayer` and `removeKeyboardLayer` functions to manage layers of `KeyboardMap` objects.

```ts
// MyGameState.ts
import { addKeyboardLayer, removeKeyboardLayer, registerFocusables } from 'dill-pixel';

init() {

  // addKeyboardLayer() is usually called in the init method of your state

  addKeyboardLayer(); 

  // Create and register some focusable elements

  const button1 = this.add.coloredSprite({ color: 0xff0000, width: 100, height: 100 });
  const button2 = this.add.coloredSprite({ color: 0x00ff00, width: 100, height: 100 });
  const button3 = this.add.coloredSprite({ color: 0x0000ff, width: 100, height: 100 });

  button1.focusable = button2.focusable = button3.focusable = true;

  registerFocusables(button1, button2, button3);
}

destroy() {
  // Remove the keyboard layer
  removeKeyboardLayer();

  // Call the super method or your state will not be destroyed
  super.destroy()
}
```

### Popups
When a popup is shown, it automatically adds its own `KeyboardMap` layer, and removes the layer when it's hidden.
This allows the popup to handle keyboard inputs without interfering with the rest of the application.

<Aside type="caution" title="Be careful!">
  If you don't keep track of the layers you add and remove, you may end up with a layer that is never removed, which can cause unexpected behaviour.
