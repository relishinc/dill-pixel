# Dill Pixel Examples

__A test project for ongoing work on HLF__

## Development

- This project currently assumes you have a local version of the [HLF framework](https://github.com/relishinc/hlf)
  installed at `../relish-hlf`
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm run dev` to start the vite development server
- make changes to the code
- see them reflected at http://localhost:3000

## Purpose

- While cleaning up the HLF framework, we can use this project to test the changes / new features
- This project can also be used to test the HLF framework in general
